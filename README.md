Combating Cardiovascular Diseases with Big Data

Overview

This repository demonstrates the application of Big Data and machine learning techniques to analyze, predict, and mitigate cardiovascular diseases. By leveraging data preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling, the project provides actionable insights into heart health.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and organizing raw data for analysis, including handling missing values and outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends and patterns related to cardiovascular health, such as correlations between risk factors and disease outcomes.

Machine Learning Models: Implementing predictive algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest to identify individuals at high risk for cardiovascular diseases.

Technologies Used

Programming Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest

Dataset

Size: Approximately 3000 records with multiple attributes related to patient health.

Description: Key features include age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and target labels indicating the presence or absence of cardiovascular diseases.
